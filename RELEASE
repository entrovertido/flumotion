Release notes for Flumotion 0.8.1 "Fo Bar"
        
The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the stable 0.8 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

After some months of wild development, we recalled it was time to give a
small update to our stable series by fixing some of the most annoying bugs
we have bumped into.

We spent some time to fix some issues with the firewire producer and the
effects it uses. As a result, that annoying choppy audio should be gone now.

Apart from that, this release includes some minor bugfixes and cosmetic
differences that were added after 0.8.0. Below is the summary of the changes
since the last stable release codenamed "7 Portes".

Features of this release

      * Added Python 2.7 compatibility.

      * The wizzard allows serving an HTML page with the video tag (for Ogg
        and WebM streams). Thanks Zaheer!

      * The wizard and admin now remember the last directory used when
        exporting/importing a flow file to/from the filesystem.


Known issues

      * The firewire producer may produce choppy audio with old versions of
        gstreamer-plugins-base. If possible upgrade to a version greater than 0.10.26.
